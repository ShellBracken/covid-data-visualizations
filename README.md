# covid-data-visualizations
After cleaning and merging New York City Covid-19 data with city shelter data from the same time span, I attempted to produce charts to provide visualizations and insights into the trends and possible correlations. 
While it might be easy to think that soaring case counts would lead to an increase in destitution and necessity of sheltering, there are other factors such as the moratorium on eviction early onto the pandemic as well as unemployment benefits which makes such a case not so clear-cut. 
Hopefully while the efforts continue to subside the pandemic the data of the past 17 months can be studied to better understand what was effective policy, and what can be learned from failures in procedure and preparation.
